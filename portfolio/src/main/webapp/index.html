                <p class="a">My name is Eva Lee. I am second-year student 
                    currently studying at Queen's University, Canada. My major is computer 
                    science with a specialization at Artificial Intelligence Stream. </p>

                <p class="a">I am a multicultural and multilingual person. 
                    Before high school, I was studying in Taiwanese education system. Hence, I am 
                    culturally Taiwanese and have no problem speak or write Mandarin. I can also 
                    speak Taiwanese. Starting high school, I started my journey of studying abroad. 
                    I was in International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP) for two years. 
                    Meanwhile, I am very interested in Japanese culture. Therefore, I have 
                    learned Japanese on my own. My Japanese language level is between N3~N2 in 
                    JLPT system. </p>

                    <p>Anime <i>Space Brothers</i> is one of my favorite anime. I watched
                        the series on TV when I was in middle school. I educated me to be a 
                        better person and motivated me to be a software engineer. It was 
                        because of this anime, I found what I wanted to do for future (at 
                        least for now)</p>
